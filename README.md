# 🎙️ AI Voice Assistant with OpenAI GPT-3 & IBM Watson

I built this project to explore how AI can power voice-based applications.
This voice assistant listens to the user, understands their query using OpenAI's GPT-3, and replies with a natural-sounding voice using IBM Watson Speech Libraries — all packed into a responsive web app.

## 📝 Overview
This project brings together:

🎤 Speech-to-Text (STT): IBM Watson converts spoken input into text

🤖 GPT-3 Natural Language Processing: OpenAI’s GPT-3 processes and generates responses

🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS): IBM Watson transforms responses into speech

🌐 Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly web interface

🖥️ Backend: Python with Flask to handle API integration and communication

## 🧩 What I Learned
How voice assistants are structured and used in real-world applications

Working with speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs

Integrating OpenAI GPT-3 for conversational intelligence

Building a Flask backend with a simple yet effective web frontend

Basics of API usage, request handling, and real-time communication

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
OpenAI GPT-3 — for intelligent conversation

IBM Watson Speech Libraries — for voice input/output

Flask (Python) — backend server

HTML/CSS/JavaScript — frontend interface

## 📋 Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript is helpful

OpenAI and IBM Watson API credentials

## 🚀 How to Run This Project
Clone the Repository

git clone your-repo-link

cd project-folder

Install Python Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set API Keys & Credentials

Configure your OpenAI API Key and IBM Watson credentials in environment variables or config files

Start the Flask Server

python app.py

Open in Browser

Go to http://localhost:5000 and start using the assistant!

## 🏁 Conclusion
I’m excited to have completed this project and learned how to connect voice technology with AI-powered responses.

This project opened up many possibilities for building assistants that are intelligent, interactive, and impactful.

I now have a better understanding of:

Combining STT, NLP, and TTS in a web application

Building AI-powered products with ethical and responsible considerations

Using prompt engineering to customize GPT-3 behavior for different use cases

## 🚀 What's Next?
I plan to explore prompt engineering further and customize this assistant for different roles like:

🧘 Therapist

🔧 Mechanic Advisor

📖 Storyteller

👨‍🏫 Professor

With a better UI/UX, this project could easily evolve into a full-scale product!
